# Automated Rubiks Cube Solver

Ongoing work-in-progress. Goal is to design a system that is able to grab and automatically solve a Rubik's cube after reading the colors off of the cube via a webcam. A demonstration of the mechanical portion of the build can be seen via the following youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32NWT3KxtNk. A demonstration of the color calibration utility can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z36a5fC41Q
